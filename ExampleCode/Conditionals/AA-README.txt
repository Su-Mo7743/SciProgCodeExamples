Take these and work / modify them and explore what happens,

OneWayConditional.py  	     Simple one way (if) conditional.


TwoWayConditional.py        Simple two way (if else) conditional

RootTwo.py		    Simply math.sqrt(x)**2 = x test to show the dangers
			    of using test on floats; also the solution.

ThreeWayConditional.py	    Basic if elfi else structure, look at this
			    carefully and understand it.

ComplexQuadrant.py	    Determine the quadrant of a complex numbers with a
			    conditional chain in a function with multiple
			    return options.  

InsideSphere.py		    Two way conditional in function and main program
			    to test if a point is within a sphere.




FunctionCall.py		    Example with function calls if conditional tests,
