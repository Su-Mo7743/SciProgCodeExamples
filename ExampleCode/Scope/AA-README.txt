Some example of scope of global variables, a dangerous area and should
be ignored by novice programmers, generally if you are needing to use
globals then at this stage you are either going it wrong or have vastly
over complicated the problem.

MainScope.py	     Scope of global variables in a main() program.

ReadScope.py	     Reading a global in main() and function().
		     Possible use, but poor style.

FunctionScope.py     A global "tangle", correct Python just not
		     what you expect.
